          We are just two friends who met in the school.We built this website because this is our final project.
          We decided to do it about basketball and if its going to be about basketball it has to be relevant with Nba we said.
          So this website basically about Nba teams and their histories and best players.We also added some highlights videos about the teams.
          We hope that this website is useful to people who has interest with basketball and also helps us to pass our lesson with a good grade.
          Have fun with this site..:)
