            The San Antonio Spurs are an American professional basketball team based in San Antonio. The Spurs compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Southwest Division. The team plays its home games at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.
            <br />
            The Spurs are one of four former American Basketball Association (ABA) teams to remain intact in the NBA after the 1976 ABA–NBA merger[8] and are the only former ABA team to have won an NBA championship.[9] The franchise has won NBA championships in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014.[10] As of the 2019–20 season, the Spurs had the highest winning percentage among active NBA franchises.[11] As of May 2017, the Spurs had the best winning percentage of any franchise in the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada over the previous three decades.[12] From 1999–2000 to 2016–17, the Spurs won 50 games each season,[13] setting a record of 18 consecutive 50-win seasons.[14] In the 2018–19 season, the Spurs matched an NBA record for most consecutive playoff appearances with 22.[15] The team's recent success has coincided with the tenure of current head coach Gregg Popovich[10][16] and with the playing careers of Spurs icons David Robinson (1989–2003) and Tim Duncan (1997–2016).
